# Stroke Risk ML Addendum

## Overview
This project is a Machine Learning extension of the original stroke risk data analysis project. It applies machine learning models and principles to extend the findings beyond exploratory and bivariate analysis, focusing on predictive modeling to identify key stroke risk factors.

## Objectives
- Apply supervised machine learning techniques to predict stroke occurrence.
- Explore feature selection methods to identify important predictors.
- Address class imbalance through resampling techniques.
- Evaluate model performance using ROC-AUC, precision, recall, and other metrics.
